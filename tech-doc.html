                <p>
                    CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) is used to style and lay out web pages — for example, to alter the
                    font, colour, size and spacing of your content, split it into multiple columns, or add animations
                    and other decorative features. This module gets you started on the path to CSS mastery with the
                    basics of how it works, including selectors and properties, writing CSS rules, applying CSS to
                    HTML, how to specify length, colour, and other units in CSS, cascade and inheritance, and debugging
                    CSS.
                </p>
                <p>Before starting this module, you should have:</p>

                    <li>
                        Basic familiarity with using computers, and using the Web passively (i.e. just looking at it,
                        consuming the content.)

                <p>
                    CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) allows you to create great looking web pages, but how does it work
                    under the hood? This
                    article explains what CSS is, how the browser turns HTML into a Document Object Model (DOM), how
                    CSS is applied to
                    parts of the DOM, some very basic syntax examples, and what code is used to actually include our
                    CSS in our web page.
                </p>
                <h2>What is CSS?</h2>
                <p>
                    As we have mentioned before, CSS is a language for specifying how documents are presented to users
                    —
                    how they are
                    styled, laid out, etc.

                    A document is usually a text file structured using a markup language — HTML is the most common
                    markup language, but you
                    will also come across other markup languages such as SVG or XML.

                    Presenting a document to a user means converting it into a usable form for your audience. Browsers,
                    like Firefox,
                    Chrome or Internet Explorer, are designed to present documents visually, for example, on a computer
                    screen, projector
                    or printer.
                </p>
                <h2>How does CSS affect HTML?</h2>
                <p>
                    Web browsers apply CSS rules to a document to affect how they are displayed. A CSS rule is formed
                    from:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        A set of properties, which have values set to update how the HTML content is displayed, for
                        example I want my element's
                        width to be 50% of its parent element, and its background to be red.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        A selector, which selects the element(s) you want to apply the updated property values to. For
                        example, I want to apply
                        my CSS rule to all the paragraphs in my HTML document.
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                    A set of CSS rules contained within a stylesheet determines how a webpage should look. You will
                    learn a lot more
                    about
                    what CSS syntax looks like in the next article of the module — CSS Syntax.
                </p>
                <h2>A quick CSS example</h2>
                <p>The above descriptions may or may not have made sense, so let's make sure things are clear by
                    presenting a quick
                    example. First of all, let's take a simple HTML document, containing an <code>h1</code> and a <code>p</code>(notice
                    that a stylesheet is applied to the HTML using a <code></code>link</code> element):</p>
                <pre>
                    <code>
                        h1 {
                        color: blue;
                        background-color: yellow;
                        border: 1px solid black;
                        }

                        p {
                        color: red;
                        }
                    </code>
                </pre>
                <p>
                    The first rule starts with an h1 selector, which means that it will apply its property values to
                    the <code>h1</code> element. It contains three properties and their values (each property/value
                    pair is called a <b>declaration</b>):
                </p>
                <ol>
                    <li>The first one sets the text color to blue.</li>
                    <li>The second sets the background color to yellow.</li>
                    <li>The third one puts a border around the header that is 1 pixel wide, solid (not dotted, or
                        dashed, etc.), and colored
                        black.</li>
                </ol>
                <p>
                    The second rule starts with a p selector, which means that it will apply its property values to the
                    <code>p</code> element. It
                    contains one declaration, which sets the text color to red.
                </p>
                <p>
                    In a web browser, the code above would produce the following output:

                <p>
                    This isn't too pretty, but at least it starts to give you an idea of how CSS works.

                <h2>A touch of vocabulary</h2>
                <p>At its most basic level, CSS consists of two building blocks:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><b>Properties:</b> Human-readable identifiers that indicate which stylistic features (e.g.
                        font, width, background color) you want to change.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <b>Values:</b>Each specified property is given a value, which indicates how you want to change
                        those stylistic features (e.g.
                        what you want to change the font, width or background color to.)
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <p>A property paired with a value is called a CSS declaration. CSS declarations are put within CSS
                    Declaration Blocks. And
                    finally, CSS declaration blocks are paired with selectors to produce <i>CSS Rulesets (or CSS Rules)</i>.</p>
                <pre>
                    <code>
                        h1 {
                        colour: blue;
                        background-color: yellow;
                        border: 1px solid black;
                        }

                        p {
                        color: red;
                        }

                        p, li {
                        text-decoration: underline;
                        }
                    </code>
                </pre>
                <h2>CSS declarations</h2>
                <p>
                    Setting CSS properties to specific values is the core function of the CSS language. The CSS engine
                    calculates which
                    declarations apply to every single element of a page in order to appropriately lay it out and style
                    it. What is
                    important to remember is that both properties and values are case-sensitive in CSS. The property
                    and value in each pair
                    is separated by a colon (<code>:</code>).
                </p>
                <img src="https://mdn.mozillademos.org/files/3665/css%20syntax%20-%20declaration.png" alt="css-declaration">
                <p>There are more than 300 different properties in CSS and nearly an infinite number of different
                    values. Not all pairs of
                    properties and values are allowed; each property has a specific list of valid values defined for
                    it.</p>

            <article>
                <h2>Type selectors aka element selectors</h2>
                <p>This selector is just a case-insensitive match between the selector name and a given HTML element
                    name. This is the
                    simplest way to target all elements of a given type. Let's take a look at an example:</p>
                <p>A simple style sheet:</p>
                <pre>
                    <code>
                        /* All p elements are red */
                        p {
                        color: red;
                        }

                        /* All div elements are blue */
                        div {
                        color: blue;
                        }
                    </code>
                </pre>
                <h2>Class seclectors</h2>
                <p>
                    The class selector consists of a dot, '.', followed by a class name. A class name is any value,
                    without spaces, placed
                    within an HTML class attribute. It is up to you to choose a name for the class. It is also
                    noteworthy that multiple
                    elements in a document can have the same class value, and a single element can have multiple class
                    names separated by
                    white space. Here's a quick example:
                </p>
                <pre>
                    <code>
                        /* The element with the class "first" is bolded */
                        .first {
                        font-weight: bold;
                        }

                        /* All the elements with the class "done" are strike through */
                        .done {
                        text-decoration: line-through;
                        }
                    </code>
                </pre>
                <h2>ID selector</h2>
                <p>The ID selector consists of a hash/pound symbol (#), followed by the ID name of a given element. Any
                    element can have a
                    unique ID name set with the id attribute. It is up to you to choose an ID name. It's the most
                    efficient way to select a
                    single element.</p>
                <pre>
                    <code>
                        #polite {
                        font-family: cursive;
                        }

                        #rude {
                        font-family: monospace;
                        text-transform: uppercase;
                        }
                    </code>
                </pre>
                <h2>Universal selector</h2>
                <p>The universal selector (*) is the ultimate joker. It allows selecting all elements in a page. As it
                    is rarely used to
                    apply a style to every element on a page, it is often used in combination with other selectors (see
                    Combinators.)</p>
                <pre>
                    <code>

                <h2>Presence and value attribute selectors</h2>
                <p>These attribute selectors try to match an exact attribute value:</p>

                    <li><code>[attr]</code>: This selector will select all elements with the attribute <code>attr</code>,
                        whatever its value.</li>
                    <li><code>[attr=val]</code>: This selector will select all elements with the attribute <code>attr</code>,
                        but only if its value is <code>val</code>.</li>
                    <li><code>[attr~=val]</code>: This selector will select all elements with the attribute <code>attr</code>,
                        but only if <code>val</code> is one of a space-separated list of
                        words contained in <code>attr</code>'s value..</li>

            <article>
                <p>There are many value types in CSS, some of them very common and some of them that you'll rarely come
                    across. We won't
                    cover all of them exhaustively in this article; just the ones that you are likely to find most
                    useful as you continue
                    on your path towards mastering CSS. In this article we will cover the following CSS values:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Numeric values: Length values for specifying e.g. element width, border thickness, or font
                        size, and unitless integers
                        for specifying e.g. relative line width or number of times to run an animation.</li>
                    <li>Percentages: Can also be used to specify size or length — relative to a parent container's
                        width or height for example,
                        or the default font-size.</li>
                    <li>Colors: For specifying background colors, text colors, etc.</li>
                    <li>Coordinate positions: e.g. for specifying the position of a positioned element relative to the
                        top left of the screen.</li>
                    <li>Functions: For specifying e.g. background images or background image gradients.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>You'll also see examples of such units in use all the way through the rest of the CSS topic, and
                    just about every other
                    CSS resource you see! You'll get used to it all in no time.</p>

                <p>With the basics of the CSS language covered, the next CSS topic for you to concentrate on is styling
                    text — one of the most common things you'll do with CSS. Here we look at text styling fundamentals,
                    including setting font, boldness, italics, line and letter spacing, drop shadows and other text
                    features. We round off the module by looking at applying custom fonts to your page, and styling
                    lists and links.</p>

            <article>
                <h2>A simple example</h2>
                <p>To begin with, let's look at a simple list example. Throughout this article, we'll look at unordered, ordered, and description lists — all have styling features that are similar, and some that are particular to their type of list. The unstyled example is available on Github (check out the source code too.)</p>
                <h2>Handling list spacing</h2>
                <p>When styling lists, you need to adjust their styles so they keep the same vertical spacing as their surrounding elements (such as paragraphs and images; sometimes called vertical rhythm), and the same horizontal spacing as each other (you can see the finished styled example on Github, and find the source code too.)</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>The first rule sets a sitewide font and a baseline font size of 10px. These are inherited by everything on the page.</li>
                    <li>Rules 2 and 3 set relative font sizes for the headings, different list types (the children of the list elements inherit these), and paragraphs. This means that each paragraph and list will have the same font size and top and bottom spacing, helping to keep the vertical rhythm consistent.</li>
                    <li>Rule 4 sets the same line-height on the paragraphs and list items — so the paragraphs and each individual list item will have the same spacing between lines. This will also help to keep the vertical rhythm consistent.</li>
                    <li>Rules 5 and 6 apply to the description list — we set the same line-height on the description list terms and descriptions as we did with the paragraphs and list items. Again, consistency is good! We also make the description terms have bold font, so they visually stand out easier.</li>
                </ul>

                <h2>Let's look at some links</h2>
                <p>We looked at how links are implemented in your HTML according to best practices in Creating hyperlinks. In this article we'll build on this knowledge, showing you best practices for styling links.</p>
                <p>The first thing to understand is the concept of link states — different states that links can exist in, which can be styled using different pseudo-classes:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><b>Link (unvisited)</b>: The default state that a link resides in, when it isn't in any other state. This can be specifically styled using the <code>:link</code> pseudo class.</li>
                    <li><b>Visited</b>: A link when it has already been visited (exists in the browser's history), styled using the <code>:visited</code> pseudo class.</li>
                    <li><b>Hover</b>: A link when it is being hovered over by a user's mouse pointer, styled using the <code>:hover</code> pseudo class.</li>
                    <li><b>Focus</b>: A link when it has been focused (for example moved to by a keyboard user using the <kbd>Tab</kbd> key or similar, or programmatically focused using <code>HTMLElement.focus()</code>) — this is styled using the <code>:focus</code> pseudo class.</li>
                    <li><b>Active</b>: A link when it is being activated (e.g. clicked on), styled using the :active pseudo class.</li>
                </ul>
